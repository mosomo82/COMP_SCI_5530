Consequently, they've chosen to churn in pursuit of a more competitive offer elsewhere, despite their prior investment in supplemental services.",1,neutral,high price,satisfied
2320-JRSDE,"This new customer, part of a household with a partner and dependents, likely signed up for essential services, possibly seeking to establish crucial internet connectivity for their family. When faced with a critical ""no internet service"" issue right after joining, their reliance on TechSupport for a quick resolution was paramount, given their non-tech-savvy nature. The subsequent poor support experience, especially for an individual on a month-to-month contract, immediately eroded their trust and prompted them to churn within their first month rather than tolerate unreliability.",1,neutral,unreliable service,dissatisfied
2332-EFBJY,"This customer is likely a single individual, preferring a straightforward, no-frills service as evidenced by their lack of internet and multiple lines from us.

1977-STDKI,"This customer is an independent senior, likely living alone, who quickly adopted high-speed fiber internet and online backup, indicating a desire for modern connectivity and data security despite opting out of tech support. Being a brand-new customer on a month-to-month contract, their immediate churn over a $73.0 billing dispute for their very first month's charges highlights a low tolerance for perceived financial discrepancies.
